module Diagrams.Actions where

{-| ActionSets can be attached to diagrams with `Core.tagWithActions`, and used
with module `Diagrams.Interact`. Build them with e.g.
    
    { emptyActionSet | click <- Just <| keepBubbling <| \(MouseEvent evt) -> SomeAction evt.offset }

(Will probably think of helpers to make this more concise later). See the `Diagrams.Interact` docs
and the GraphEditor example for more info on how to use actions, including how bubbling works.
